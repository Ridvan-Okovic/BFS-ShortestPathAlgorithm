# BFS_ShortestPathAlgorithm
This was my project for Discrete Math 2 course where we needed to create a shortest path algorithm using adjacency matrix. The two .csv files are the names of the cities included in the search and the second one is from which city you can go to the other or the actual adjacency matrix.
